# First MLOps Project

A professional medical MLOps project designed to streamline machine learning workflows in healthcare applications. This project leverages containerization for reproducibility and scalability.

## Features

- Automated model training and deployment
- Scalable architecture using Docker
- Continuous integration and delivery
- Secure handling of medical data

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Python 3.8+
- Git

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/first-mlops-project.git
cd first-mlops-project
```

### Build and Run with Docker

#### Dockerfile Example

```dockerfile
# Use official Python image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy project files
COPY . .

# Expose port (if using a web service)
EXPOSE 5000

# Run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

Build and run the container:

```bash
docker build -t first-mlops-project .
docker run -p 5000:5000 first-mlops-project
```

## Future Scope

- Integration with cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Advanced model monitoring and logging
- Automated data validation and drift detection
- Support for federated learning for privacy-preserving healthcare AI

## Future Implementation

- Deploying models as RESTful APIs for real-time inference
- Implementing CI/CD pipelines for seamless updates
- Adding support for multiple ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Enhanced security and compliance for medical data (HIPAA, GDPR)
